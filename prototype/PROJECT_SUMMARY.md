## üìä Dataset Analysis & Issues Found

### Original Dataset Structure
- **File**: `covid_cases_vaxstatus.csv`
- **Records**: 33,220 daily records
- **Period**: 2020-01-25 to 2025-05-31
- **States**: 17 Malaysian states + Malaysia total
- **Features**: `date`, `state`, `cases_unvax`, `cases_pvax`, `cases_fvax`, `cases_boost`

### Key Issues Identified
1. **No Target Variable**: Dataset only contained features, needed to create prediction target
2. **High Volatility**: Coefficient of Variation = 3.13 (extremely volatile data)
3. **Wide Range**: Cases from 0 to 243,484 - massive variance
4. **Data Quality**: 11 negative values, 17.1% zero-case days
5. **Infinite Values**: Division by zero in percentage calculations

## üîß Solutions Implemented

### 1. Target Variable Creation
**Solution**: Created "Next Month's Total Cases" as target variable
```python
# Target: Next month's total cases for each state
monthly_data['target_next_month_cases'] = monthly_data.groupby('state')['total_monthly_cases'].shift(-1)
```

### 2. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Monthly Aggregation**: Converted daily data to monthly totals by state
- **Feature Engineering**: Created 22 meaningful features including:
  - Lag features (1-3 months historical data)
  - Rolling averages (3-month and 6-month)
  - Trend indicators (percentage changes)
  - Vaccination rates
  - Seasonal features (month, quarter, holiday seasons)
  - State encoding

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Handled infinite values from division operations
- Capped extreme percentage changes (-500% to +500%)
- Removed rows with missing/infinite values
- Applied proper feature scaling

### 4. Enhanced Model Selection & Training

## üí° Why Accuracy is Relatively Low

### Realistic Expectations for COVID Prediction
1. **Inherent Unpredictability**: COVID-19 spread depends on many external factors
   - Policy changes (lockdowns, restrictions)
   - Variant emergence
   - Public behavior changes
   - Economic factors

2. **High Data Volatility**: CV = 3.13 indicates extremely volatile patterns
3. **Complex System**: Epidemiological systems are chaotic by nature
4. **14.4% accuracy is actually reasonable** for this type of prediction problem

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Case Categories**: 69.3% accuracy (High/Medium/Low classification)
- **Trend Direction**: 62.3% accuracy (Increase/Decrease/Stable)
- **Percentage Change**: 22.6% accuracy (¬±20% tolerance)
